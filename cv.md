* **A little bit about yourself:** I'm a lawyer by profession. I've been on maternity leave for three years. Now I'm looking for a new profession. I've chosen JS. It's challenging for me, but it's also interesting. I love learning, exploring new things, and trying my hand at new fields. I'm hardworking, diligent, and organized. Studying is not easy for me, but I'm curious about where it will lead.

* I have no programming skills, and I'm starting from scratch.
* English language proficiency level A1
